# Hi, I’m Sakshi 👋

I’m a **Business Analytics graduate student at UMass Amherst** with hands-on experience in **Python, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization**. I enjoy turning messy, real-world data into clear insights that support better business decisions.

I began my career at **Accenture**, working in quality engineering for large-scale enterprise systems. That experience sharpened my eye for data accuracy, edge cases, and process gaps, and ultimately led me toward analytics and data science.


## 🔍 What I Work On

My projects focus on **end-to-end analytics**, from data cleaning and exploration to modeling and business recommendations. You’ll find work related to:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering  
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks)  
- SQL analytics (joins, aggregations, window functions)  
- Dashboards and KPI design (Tableau, Power BI)  
- Translating model results into business insights  



## 📂 Featured Projects

### Loan Approval Prediction (Python, Machine Learning)
Built an end-to-end classification pipeline, optimized recall using decile-based cutoff analysis, and identified key drivers of loan approval risk to support data-driven credit decisioning.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/agarwalsakshi-x/Predicting-Loan-Approval

### Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy
Analyzed 7,000+ IBM telecom customers, developed predictive churn models (AUC ≈ 0.85), and translated model insights into targeted retention strategies linked to revenue impact.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/agarwalsakshi-x/IBM-Telco-Customer-Churn

### Supply Chain Performance & Risk Analytics (SQL, Tableau)
Processed 100K+ supplier records, built operational KPIs using advanced SQL, and designed dashboards to uncover delivery delays, supplier risk, and performance bottlenecks.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/agarwalsakshi-x/supplychain-performance-sql

### Amazon Prime Air Drone Hub Optimization (Supply Chain Analytics, Location Modeling)
Designed a statewide drone delivery network for Massachusetts using Center of Gravity optimization, coverage radius analysis, and Huff gravity demand modeling. Quantified population coverage, estimated daily drone volumes, and recommended a phased three-hub deployment strategy (Newton, Worcester, Springfield) to maximize service reach and operational efficiency.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Analytics:** EDA, Statistical Analysis, KPI Design  
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, Excel

## 🌱 What I’m Learning Next

- Improving my Python and SQL skills through more hands-on projects  
- Practicing model evaluation and threshold tuning for real business use cases  
- Building clearer dashboards and stories that explain model results to non-technical audiences  
- Applying what I learn in class to real industry-style problems
