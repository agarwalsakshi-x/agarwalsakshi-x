## Hi, I’m Sakshi 👋

I’m a **Business Analytics graduate student at UMass Amherst** focused on turning raw data into clear, decision-ready insights using **SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau**.

My work centers on **business intelligence, KPI reporting, and operational analytics**, where I build dashboards, analyze trends, and translate complex data into actionable recommendations that improve performance, reduce risk, and support strategic decision-making.

Before graduate school, I worked at **Accenture**, supporting enterprise systems and data quality initiatives, which strengthened my focus on accuracy, process improvement, and stakeholder communication.

## 🔍 What I Work On

My projects focus on **end-to-end analytics workflows**, including:

- Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering  
- Machine learning for prediction and decision support  
- SQL-based business analytics and KPI development  
- Dashboarding and visualization for stakeholder communication  
- Translating analytical results into **actionable business recommendations**  

## 📂 Featured Projects

### Loan Approval Prediction (Python, Machine Learning)
Built an end-to-end classification pipeline, optimized recall using decile-based cutoff analysis, and identified key drivers of loan approval risk to support **data-driven credit decisioning**.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/agarwalsakshi-x/Predicting-Loan-Approval

### Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy
Analyzed 7,000+ telecom customers, developed predictive churn models (**AUC ≈ 0.85**), and translated model insights into **targeted retention strategies linked to revenue impact**.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/agarwalsakshi-x/IBM-Telco-Customer-Churn

### Supply Chain Performance & Risk Analytics (SQL, Tableau)
Processed 100K+ supplier records, built operational KPIs using advanced SQL, and designed dashboards to uncover **delivery delays, supplier risk, and performance bottlenecks**.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/agarwalsakshi-x/supplychain-performance-sql

### Amazon Prime Air Drone Hub Optimization (Supply Chain Analytics, Location Modeling)
Designed a statewide drone delivery network for Massachusetts using **Center of Gravity optimization, coverage modeling, and Huff demand analysis**. Quantified service reach, estimated daily drone volumes, and recommended a **phased three-hub deployment strategy** to maximize statewide efficiency.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/agarwalsakshi-x/Amazon-Prime-Air-Drone-Hub-Analysis

### Plant Company Performance Dashboard (Power BI, DAX)

Developed an interactive multi-page **Power BI executive dashboard** analyzing **Sales, Gross Profit, and Quantity performance** across countries, products, and time. Designed KPI cards for **YTD, PYTD, variance, and GP%**, built waterfall and trend visuals to highlight performance changes, and enabled stakeholder-driven exploration via filters and segmentation analysis to support **data-driven operational and profitability decisions**.
