# Hi, I’m Sakshi 👋

I’m a **Business Analytics graduate student at UMass Amherst** with hands-on experience in **Python, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization**. I enjoy turning messy, real-world data into clear insights that support better business decisions.

I began my career at **Accenture**, working in quality engineering for large-scale enterprise systems. That experience sharpened my eye for data accuracy, edge cases, and process gaps, and ultimately led me toward analytics and data science.


## 🔍 What I Work On

My projects focus on **end-to-end analytics**, from data cleaning and exploration to modeling and business recommendations. You’ll find work related to:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering  
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks)  
- SQL analytics (joins, aggregations, window functions)  
- Dashboards and KPI design (Tableau, Power BI)  
- Translating model results into business insights  



## 📂 Featured Projects

- **Loan Approval Prediction (Python, Machine Learning)**  
  Built an end-to-end classification pipeline, optimized recall using decile-based cutoff analysis, and identified key drivers of loan approval risk.

- **Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy**  
  Analyzed 7,000+ telecom customers, built predictive models (AUC ≈ 0.85), and recommended data-driven retention strategies tied to revenue impact.

- **Supply Chain Performance & Risk Analytics (SQL, Tableau)**  
  Cleaned and analyzed 100K+ supplier records, built KPIs, and developed dashboards to identify delivery and risk bottlenecks.  
  Repo: https://github.com/agarwalsakshi-x/supplychain-performance-sql

(More projects and documentation are added regularly.)



## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Analytics:** EDA, Statistical Analysis, KPI Design  
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, Excel  
- **Tools:** GitHub, Jupyter, AWS, Azure, Snowflake  



## 🌱 What I’m Learning Next

- Improving my Python and SQL skills through more hands-on projects  
- Practicing model evaluation and threshold tuning for real business use cases  
- Building clearer dashboards and stories that explain model results to non-technical audiences  
- Applying what I learn in class to real industry-style problems
