Hi, I’m Sakshi Agarwal — a former Quality Engineering Analyst at Accenture, now pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at UMass Amherst.

I love digging into data, finding patterns others might miss, and turning them into insights that actually make sense.

🧩 I’ve moved from testing systems to testing ideas — using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau to transform raw data into real impact.

💬 On this GitHub, you’ll find my projects in analytics, dashboards, and data storytelling — all driven by curiosity, caffeine, and a love for clean datasets. ☕📊
