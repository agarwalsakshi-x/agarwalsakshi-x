Hey there! I’m Sakshi, a data enthusiast who believes every dataset has a story waiting to be told.

I started my career at Accenture, testing digital platforms and spotting invisible gaps in complex systems - that’s where I fell in love with problem-solving.

Now, as a Business Analytics grad student at UMass Amherst, I’m exploring how data can do more than inform - it can inspire.

⚙️ Tools I speak fluently: SQL • Python • Power BI • Tableau • Excel

🚀 Welcome to my corner of the internet - where messy data turns into meaningful insight

💬 On this GitHub, you’ll find my projects in analytics, dashboards, and data storytelling - all driven by curiosity, caffeine, and a love for clean datasets. ☕📊
